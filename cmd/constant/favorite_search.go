You can search favorited phrase(s) with keyword argument(s).
Multiple keywords are separated by a space.

If you want to search favorited phrase(s) by AND condition, you can use flag "-A" or "--and".
OR condition is by default.

You can specify how many results to show with flag "-n" or "--number".
If you don't specify the number of phrases, jrp will show the most recent 10 results by default.

Also, you can show all results by flag "-a" or "--all".
If you use the flag, the number flag will be ignored.

  jrp favorite search [flag]
  jrp favorite se     [flag]
  jrp favorite S      [flag]
